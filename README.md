# calculateUD v2

For you chronically online nerds who spend every hour of the day on Iâ€‘76, here's a tool to simplify your grinding experience. UDGC can solve for how many miles you need to drive in order to reach a rank or credit goal. (This also works with French cars.)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since the creator of Ultimate Driving has decided to permanently end the game's development, this will be the final version of the calculateUD software.

> [!NOTE]
> I have another project called driveUD, which serves as a rudimentary self-driving script for UD cars. Because UD has reached its end-of-life, moderation overall is reduced. Use driveUD at your own discretion.
