# calculateUD v2

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As the creator of Ultimate Driving has decided to stop development on the game, this is the final version of the calculateUD software.

For you chronically online nerds who spend every hour of the day on Iâ€‘76, here's a tool to simplify your grinding experience. UDGC can solve for how many miles you need to drive in order to reach a rank or credit goal. (This also works with French cars.)

> [!NOTE]
> I have another project called driveUD, which serves as a rudimentary self-driving script for UD cars. Because UD has reached its end-of-life, moderation on afk grinding is reduced. Use driveUD at your discretion.
